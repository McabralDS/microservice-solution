# Test Strategy

This microservice, designed to handle high load scenarios, has an automated testing strategy focused on unit testing with plans for integration and load testing.

## Unit Testing

 - Automated unit tests are implemented using `Vitest`, covering core business rules and edge cases.
 - The goal is to maintain a minimum of 90% code coverage across statements, branches, functions, and lines.
 - Unit tests are executed automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline to prevent regressions and ensure code quality.

## Integration Test
    - Tests to validate the full data flow through the API, service layer, and database integration are planned for future implementation.
    - These tests will verify end-to-end behavior with realistic scenarios.

## Load Test
    - Considering the API’s performance goals — response times under 500ms and less than 10% degradation under heavy load — load testing is strongly recommended.
    - Load tests should simulate realistic traffic patterns, including concurrent reads and writes.
    - Tests are preferably run during off-peak hours to avoid impacting production users.
    - Metrics to monitor include response latency (p95, p99), error rates, CPU and memory utilization, and pod scaling behavior via Kubernetes HPA.
